# Grocery-Tracking
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  
The project takes a txt file with a list of sold items at a grocery store and aggregates the list to keep a running total of how much of each item has been sold. The allows a grocery store to see what items sell more often so they may optimize their product layout, as well as anticipate what items to restock sooner.

- What did you do particularly well?
  
I incorporated a map to aggregate the data in the txt file. By using the item name as a key, I was able to use the value as a counter to accurately track the frequency an item appears in the txt file. 

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  
I would likely improve my efforts at input validation as I feel that it may be a little redundant and could be less complicated by validating that the input is an integer between 1 and 4 in a singular loop.

-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found that reading the file and integrating it into the map was difficult, as this was my first time using a map. I overcame this by looking at online resources, such as my online textbook or w3school.com, in order to better understand maps. I will definitely be integrating reviewing a solid online resource into my suppoort network.

-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think class creation, method creation, maps, and try-catch blocks will be very transferable to other projects and course work. 

-How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My use of inline comments allowed this code to be readable, allowing for one to be able to understand what each line of code is doing at a glance. I believe that this code is adaptable, as all I am really doing is reading a txt file into a map, and then creating methods to draw from that map. I believe that creates a template for all sort of different applications. Lastly, this code is maintanable by using proper name conventions for methods, variables, and classes, as well as breaking processes down into smaller and reusable modules.
